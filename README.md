✅ Reason why Node and NPM versions are different

👉 Node.js version

Represents the version of the JavaScript runtime you installed.
Example: v25.2.0

👉 NPM version

Represents the version of the package manager installed with Node.
Example: 11.6.2

They are not tied together, so their version numbers will never match.


🎉 One-Line Summary

👉 Node runs JavaScript.
👉 NPM installs JavaScript libraries.



NVM = Node Version Manager
It is a tool that allows you to install, switch, and manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same computer.

⸻

🚀 Why NVM is important?

Different projects need different Node versions.

Example:
	•	Angular 16 works best with Node 18
	•	Angular 17 needs Node 20
	•	Some old React/Node apps need Node 14
	•	Your system might have Node 25

Without NVM → You are stuck with ONE Node version.
With NVM → You can switch Node versions anytime with one command.
